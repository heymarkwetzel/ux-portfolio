## Summary

My friend (also co-founder), Jasna, and I share a love of travel. She had recently gone on an extended trip and wished she had an easier way to share her adventures directly with people share cares about instead of blasting a post off to hundreds of folks on the Insta, FB, or Tweeterverse.

We had initially discussed a fully interactive journal experience with maps, lists, media, suggestions, search, recommendation, and… well, a whole lot more. For MVP, we boiled it down to the idea of a custom postcard complete with front and back.

## Discovery

I interviewed Jasna to gather requirements, establish scope, and zero in on how best to accomplish our goals. Our priorities were to keep it:
- Simple
- Quick
- Personal

### Keep it simple
We provide one custom filter, no choosing. The “Greetings from” copy can only be one of three fonts and four colors, simple to cycle through.

### Keep it quick
Especially if you’re out traveling, you want to spend as little time on your device as possible. The best moments of travel are making memories. Choosing or taking a photo is effortless and the messaging writing experience is familiar.

### Keep it personal
We prioritize sending the Postikard via text or email so that you are sharing your story with an individual. But, it’s also very easy to share to social media or save to do whatever you’d like with it!

## Design

I went to the drawing board and gathered my notes into sketches and wireframes.
